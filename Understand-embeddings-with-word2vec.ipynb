    "You might wonder where does this magic comes from (at quite a low price, you just ran a line of code on a very small corpus and it was trained within few minutes). The magic comes from the way Word2Vec is trained. The details are quite complex, but you can remember that Word2vec, in `word2vec = Word2Vec(sentences=X_train)`, actually trains a internal neural network (that you don't see).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, this internal neural network predicts a word from the surroundings words in a sentences. Hence, it splits the original sentences, then for each split it chooses some words as inputs $X$ and a word as the output $y$ which it tries to predict, using the embedding space.\n",

    "And as with any neural network, Word2Vec has some hyperparameters. Let's play with some of these. "
